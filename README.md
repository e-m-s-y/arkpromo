# ArkPromo

ArkPromo enables retailers to distribute points / savings stamps (as a token) to customers on a blockchain built with Arkâ€™s Ecosystem.
The amount of tokens the customer receives (this is configurable) depends on the spending amount in fiat. 
The application will scan for a wallet address when a customer has made the purchase. The customer opens the Ark Mobile app, shows his QR-code and ArkPromo will send the tokens to the scanned address. 
A few weeks later the same customer enters the store and sees that there is a promotional offer. At the cash register the customer selects the offer from physical device (for example 1$ discount for 5 tokens). 
ArkPromo prompts the user to send the tokens and shows a QR-code. After confirmation the discount is calculated and the user can make the purchase. 
Retailers can manage their promotional offers on the physical device at any time.

With ArkPromo retailers can track the token distribution and this enables stores to monitor how promotional offers are performing.
